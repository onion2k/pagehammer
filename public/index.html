      <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who
        was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.
        There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking
        cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a
        big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no
        cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of
        those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in
        the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p>

      <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every
        side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
        directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the
        grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to
        be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it
        away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>

      <p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had
        taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and
        they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came
        to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her
        heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that
        she could find anything to laugh at.</p>

      <p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray
        also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>

      <p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not
        gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side
        of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</p>

      <p>Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which
        was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em
        was washing the dishes.</p>

      <p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long
        grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as
        they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.</p>

      <p>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>

      <p>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife. "I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward the
        sheds where the cows and horses were kept.</p>

      <p>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.</p>

      <p>"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed. "Run for the cellar!"</p>

      <p>Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly
        frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy
        caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great
        shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the
        floor.</p>

      <p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>
